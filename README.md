# UC Berkeley, EE106A, Fall 2018 Final Project Team 1 - UltraBaxter

Team Members: Amanda Boyle, Syung (Denny) Min, Daniel Benniah John, Haopeng (Jason) Liang, Junlin Liu

### Abstract:
The UltraBaxter's main goal is to be able to directly manipulate the Baxter's joints 
to mimic the user's arm motion by using various sensors to track the user's arm's 
joint positions and translating the sensor measurements to Baxter's joints.
